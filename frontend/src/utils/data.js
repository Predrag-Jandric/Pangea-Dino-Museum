    title: "Age of Dinosaurs",
    description:
      "The Age of Dinosaurs, lasting from around 230 to 66 million years ago, was a defining chapter in Earth's history when dinosaurs ruled the planet. These creatures evolved into diverse forms, from towering sauropods to fierce predators like Tyrannosaurus rex. Dinosaurs thrived in various environments, from dense forests to arid deserts, adapting to changing climates. This era also saw the rise of other prehistoric life, including early mammals, birds, and marine reptiles. The ecosystems they shaped were complex and dynamic, paving the way for future evolutionary developments before their sudden extinction.",

  {
    title: "Triassic Period",
    description:
      "The Triassic Period, spanning from 252 to 201 million years ago, marked the dawn of the Mesozoic Era and the rise of dinosaurs. Following Earth's largest mass extinction event at the end of the Permian, life began to recover, and the first dinosaurs, such as Coelophysis and Herrerasaurus, emerged. The climate was largely hot and dry, dominated by vast deserts and scattered forests. By the period's end, early dinosaurs had begun to roam around and spread, setting the stage for the larger and more dominant species of the Jurassic. This era also saw the first true mammals and flying reptiles.",
    time: "Around 252 to 201 million years ago",
  },
  {
    title: "Jurassic Period",
    description:
      "The Jurassic Period, lasting from 201 to 145 million years ago, was a golden age for dinosaurs, with species such as Brachiosaurus and Allosaurus thriving. During this time, the supercontinent Pangaea began breaking apart, leading to the diversification of dinosaurs across the globe. The climate was warm and humid, supporting dense forests and abundant plant life, which sustained massive herbivores. The first birds evolved from small theropod dinosaurs, bridging the gap between reptiles and modern avians. This period also saw the continued rise of marine reptiles and the dominance of new dinosaur groups.",
    time: "Around 201 to 145 million years ago",
  },
  {
    title: "Cretaceous Period",
    description:
      "The Cretaceous Period, from about 145 to 66 million years ago, was the final era of the dinosaurs and one of great diversity. Iconic species such as Tyrannosaurus rex and Triceratops roamed vast ecosystems alongside newly evolved flowering plants. This period also introduced duck-billed hadrosaurids and massive theropods like Spinosaurus. Marine reptiles flourished in the oceans, while early mammals began to diversify. However, the Cretaceous ended in catastrophe with a mass extinction event that wiped out most dinosaurs, changing life on Earth forever and paving the way for the rise of mammals.",
