## How it works

The DiNostalgia app is built using React for the frontend, with Redux Toolkit for state management and Supabase for backend services. Here's a detailed explanation of how each section works:

- **DinoDex:**

The DinoDex component fetches dinosaur data from an API and displays it in a searchable and filterable format.
Users can search for dinosaurs by name, diet, or country of discovery. The search functionality uses regular expressions to match any part of the dinosaur name.
Clicking on a dinosaur opens a detailed modal view with more information, including images, descriptions, and additional details.

- **Timeline:**

The Timeline component provides an interactive timeline of dinosaur history, highlighting key periods and events.
Users can navigate through the timeline using next and previous buttons, and click on specific events to view detailed descriptions.

- **News:**

The News component fetches the latest dinosaur-related news articles from an external API.
Articles are displayed in a responsive grid layout, with each article linking to the original source for more information.

- **Quiz:**

The Quiz component presents a series of multiple-choice questions about dinosaurs.
Users can answer questions, and their scores are calculated based on correct answers. The quiz includes a progress bar and displays the final score.

- **Ecommerce:**

The Ecommerce component displays dinosaur-themed merchandise. Users can search and filter products by name, diet, stock, and price. The search functionality ensures that products are filtered across all pages.
Each product card includes an image, name, price, stock status, and an "Add to Cart" button.

- **Shopping Cart and Checkout:**

The Shopping Cart component allows users to manage their selected items, including updating quantities and removing items.
The Checkout component handles user authentication through Supabase and processes orders. The app ensures that the cart state is saved in local storage, allowing users to resume their shopping session even after closing the browser.
